# Pico Controller! (written in micropython!)

This is the first pico controller that i have seen on github. 

## How to use:
1. Download the .UF2 files from Pimoroni (I use it  instead of mircopython because it works well)
[here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico-rp2350/).
2. Press down the BOOTSEL button and put the .UF2 file onto the usb drive when it pops up
3. Clone this Repo(`git clone https://github.com/gobrowseraspberrypi/micropython_gpio_controler`) and get VS Code(ium)
4. Get the Raspberry Pi Pico extensions for VS Code(ium)
5. Connect your pico to VS Code(ium) and run the script
6. if you need help with any of the commands, in the script there is a help command.

If there is any errors, please report them using the issues tab.

## Git structure
The 'beta' is one that holds all versions that are not ready for public use, as they do not work well. The main branch is the stable versions. I will cherry-pick all the stable versions from beta onto main.

Making A GUI with C#, coming in a couple months (if this project gets any traction).
